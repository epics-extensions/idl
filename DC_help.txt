ScanSee  program provides a convenient IDL widget tool of displaying various 
1D/2D/3D scans saved by the IOC scan software.  This program can also serve as 
an approximate tool of displaying the realtime 1D/2D/3D scan data. The input 
raw scan data is automatically saved by the IOC in XDR format. 

This program can operate either in scan mode or view data mode. Since both 
modes share the same 1D drawing area, if a user want to see the realtime data 
1D plot while scan is going on, he should let the scan mode grab the control 
of the 1D drawing area.

This program provide a ViewData menu which allows the user easily to access 
the various scan browser sub-programs based on the type of 1D/2D/3D scan picked.
The ViewData->1D/2D... menu can bring up either W_VIEWSCAN or stand alone
scan browser (sscan). If scan is going on, to avoid the interference of 
realtime plot, the stand alone sscan (scan browser) is brought up. If no 
scan is going on, the W_VIEWSCAN program is brought up.  

For the first time to start scanSee a user should use File->Open... to select
the input scan file from the appropriate data directory. The input file name is 
automatically created by the scan saveData file system. The scan files
are sequenced accoding to the saveData sequence number. At the normal 
completion of the scanSee program a configuration file "DC.config"
is created or updated at the current startup directory. The configuration file
"DC.config" later on will be used for easy re-start.

about scanSee package.

The functionality of user interface in DC.pro is given below:
