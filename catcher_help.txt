			   CATCHER_V1
                (1D/2D Data Catcher For Scan Record)

			    OVERVIEW	

This program automatically catches and displays 1D/2D scan data 
detected by monitoring the EPICS 3.12.2 scan record.  The monitored 
scan can be invoked within the data catcher or invoked by any 
outside CA client.
 
Each scan record can contain up to 4 positioners and 15 detectors. At 
the end of each scan the defined positioners and detectors array are
automatically saved. In addition to scan data, a user can use the
environment file to save additional operating parameters.  At the 
normal completion of data catcher the new configuration file will
be automatically saved. 

This program operates in two mode: acquisition and view data mode. 
The default mode is always the data acquisition (i.e. data catching)  
mode. A user can select the view data mode to examine the scan data 
previously captured. At the end of view data mode it automatically 
returns to the data acquisition mode.

There are two view data modes: 1D and 2D. The view 2D mode is covered
by the VIEW2D program, it will not be discussed here.

The acquistion mode supercedes the view data mode. During the 1D viewing 
mode if the data catcher detects any scan invoked by the outside CA 
clients, it will close the 1D viewing mode and yields to the data 
acquisition mode right away.


			    FILE USED 

config.file		Before quiting the data catcher a configuration 
			file will be automatically saved. If not given on 
			command line, 'catch1d.config' is used.  

data.file 		This file is used to record the 1D scan data.
			Complete 1D scan data is automatically saved at 
			the end of each scan. If not given on command 
			line, 'catch1d.trashcan' is used.

env.file		This file should contain a complete list of
			environment PV variables to be saved with the
			1D scan. If not given on command line, 
			'catch1d.env' is used.

data.file.image  	This file is used to save 2D image data for all
			defined detectors for the first scan record.
			Complete 2D scan data is automatically saved at 
			the end of 2D scan. The same file name as 1D 
			data set is used plus a suffix '.image'

Report files    	Various levels of report files can be generated
			by data catcher, they are all prefixed with the
			same 1D data file name. If data file name is not
			given on command line, 'catch1d.trashcan' will
			be used.

catch1d.ps              Postscript 1D plot file. 



			   USER INTERFACE

The user interface is very simple and is a complete mouse driven.

The drawing area is used for realtime and 1D plot. In realtime 
only live data, title, x label for the selected detectors are 
plotted. Post data scan the detailed plot title, labels, legends, 
timestamp, user ID, etc. are drawn in the drawing area.

The top left corner contains the data file name. The top right corner 
contains the scan #.  The bottom left corner contains the time stamp 
when this scan started and a comment line. The bottom right corner 
contains the user name.
  
The plot title, xlabel, ylabel and comment can be set up by the user
through using the 'Plot Options->Plot ...' option.  If not specified
the default scan record database name, description and engineering 
units will be used for the plot.  A user always can use the Plot ... 
dialog to modify the plot specification at the view data mode.

The plot can be automatically scaled or user specified. The default
is auto-scaled, y-axis include zero, with a 5% margin. A user can use 
the Plot ...  dialog to modify the plot range xmin, xmax, ymin, and 
ymax in the user-scaled plot.  



		         DRAWING AREA XY-COORD

Click the Left Mouse Button (LMB) on the drawing area will draw a 
cross-hair and pops up a XY-COORD dialog. It contains a positioner
number label, two text fields, a 'GoTo' button, and a 'Close' button. 
The X and Y field shows the intersection coordinates of the cross
hair.  Press the 'GoTo' button issuing a CA put value for the
specified positioner and physically moves the positioner to the
cursur specified positon.
 

			   DETECTOR SELECTION 

The detector selection consists of 15 radio buttons. The selection button
indicates whether the detector will be plotted or not.  If pressed in
the corresponding detector data will be plotted.



			
			    SCAN ... DIALOG

The scan setup dialog allows the user to setup which scan record will
be monitored by the data catcher. It consists a row of widgets for 
1D scan control, a row of widgets for 2D scan control, a row of widgets
for alternate 2D handshake, a 'Ok' button, and a 'Close' button.

The 'Ok' button accepts all the text fields and properly setup the
data catcher for monitoring new scan. The 'Close' button closes this 
dialog and let outside CA clients have sole control of scanning.


			 1D Scan Control

The text field specifies the inner loop  PV name of a SCAN record to be 
scanned. The input should end with a carriage return.

The control of scanning consists of two buttons: 'Start' and 'Stop'.
The 'Start' button initiates the 1D scan and displays the real-time plot 
of captured data at the drawing area. The 'Stop' button aborts
the scan before the completion of 1D scan.


			 2D Scan Control

The text field specifies the outer loop PV name of a SCAN record which
controls the position of the outer loop.  The input should end with a 
carriage return.

The control of scanning consists of two buttons: 'Start' and 'Stop'.
The 'Start' button initiates the 2D scan and displays the real-time plot 
of captured data at the drawing area. The 'Stop' button aborts
the 2D scan before the completion of 2D scan.

 
			 2D Handshake Control

The text field specifies the PV name for 2D SCAN handshake, the second
text field specifies the value to be used for handshake. The input 
should end with a carriage return.




		           PLOT ... DIALOG

Plot setup dialog consists of sets of toggle buttons and input text fields
which will be used by the data catcher in generating plot. 

The plot title, x & y labels, comment text fields can be 
modified to override the default values.  The Xmin, Xmax, Ymin, Ymax are 
the plot range will be used by the user scale plot option.  The text 
field entered will be in effect by carriage return or until either the 
'Apply' or 'Done' is pressed. The 'Done' button will also close the dialog. 
If the 'Cancel' button is pressed, it aborts the text changes and close the 
dialog.


			   VIEW 1D ... DIALOG

View 1D dialog consists of: a label describes the current file opened 
for viewing, a label gives the ranges of scan data recorded in the
file, a text field signals the current record # from the opened file,
and two sets of push buttons.

The 'Modify Plot', 'ASCII Save', 'ASCII View', and 'ASCII Print'  buttons
will be active only if a set of recorded scan data is loaded into data 
catcher.

Press 'Modify Plot' allows you modify the plot specification and replot 
according to your changes.

Press 'ASCII Save' saves the scan data in a human readable ASCII file.
The save file will be named with record #, e.g., if the 5th record of
'catch1d.transhcan' is currently opened for viewing, then the file
'catch1d.trashcan.5' will be saved  by 'ASCII Save' button.

Press 'ASCII View' saves the ASCII scan data into 'catch1d.trashcan.tmp' 
file and pops up a scroll text window to display the corresponding data
for the selected scan #.

Press 'ASCII Print' prints the ASCII scan data 'catch1d.trashcan.tmp'.
Before selecting this button the 'ASCII View' button must be pressed
first. 

The text field entry allows you enter a scan #.

The slider allows you go to any valid scan record.

Press 'First' to view the scan # 1.

Press 'Next' to view the next scan #.

Press 'Prev' to view the previous scan #.

Press 'Last ' to view the last scan #.

Press 'Done' to close the view mode.



			      VIEW 2D ... DIALOG

This program allows the user flexible to browse the 2D data image data
saved by data catcher. For a given image it provides TV, SURFACE, CONTOUR, 
SHOW3, and XSURFACE plot.  For more information please refer to VIEW2D
on line help.
 

			  FILE DESCRIPTIONS

			    catcher

A UNIX script file automatically invokes the IDL data catcher for
user. From UNIX prompt enter  

	catcher -h

to get the command syntax help.


			    catch1d.config

A configuration file 'catch1d.config' will be saved at the normal 
completion of data catcher, i.e,  from the File->Quit menu.

The contents of 'catch1d.config' include scan record name, plot labels, 
plot options, and important scan setup fields of the scan record.  
Be aware that the 'catch1d.config' only remembers the last status of 
the data catcher when you exit the program. 



			     catch1d.env

The 'catch1d.env' provides the flexible feature of save additional
IOC setting values with the scan data. For each PV name defined in
'catch1d.env' the set value and description will be save.

A complete list of enviroment values will be saved for the reference 
case at the end of startup scan (reference case).  For subsequent 
scans only those values changed from the reference case will be saved.

Each line in 'catch1d.env' consists of a single valid PV name plus the 
.field name followed with the field description. The PV name and the 
description is separated at least by one blank space. The PV name plus 
the .field name can not exceed 28 characters, and the filed descrpition 
can not exceed 40 characters.  No waveform record is allowed in 
'catch1d.env'. Currently, the number of lines allowed in 'catch1d.env' 
is 1000.

If the description is not specified in 'catch1d.env' for a given PV name, 
then the description from the record .DESC will be used in save data.
Any line begins with # in the first column will be treated as a comment
line. Any PV name is prefixed by '*', it will always be included in the
saved environment data.


			catch1d_user.pro

Data catcher provided two dummy routines before_scan, and after_scan.
The before_scan routine is called at the end of scan PV name setup. 
The after_scan routine is called at the end of each 1D scan.

These two new routines facilitate the user to use the before_scan 
and after_scan to configure or condition the operation values of 
additional IOC PV fields, or calling any other task and procedure.

The data catcher automatically loads in the 'catch1d_user.pro'. This is
the place where a user can provide his/her own version of before_scan and
after_scan routines in this file.  If provided, then the user version 
of before_scan and after_scan will be used by the data catcher.



			catch1d.trashcan

The 1D scan data detected by data catcher is automatically saved in this
file.


			catch1d.trashcan.image

The 2D scan data detected by data catcher is automatically saved in this
file.
