 
			PICK3D Program

This program is specially written for viewing big 3D scan file.
It only accept 3D scan file which must be created by the IOC scan software.

The actual time used for reading a 3D scan array depends on 
the size of 3D scan and the memeory available on the operating system. 
For a 3D scan with dimensions 2000x50x50 the memory used by a single
3D data array will by 20Mb. Pick3d will only load one 3D data array 
of the selected detector into IDL.  This will reduce the memory used 
by the PICK3D and improve the program performance on UNIX.

The user first should pick the detector # desired from the detector list 
before select the 3D file from the scan file data directory. At the normal 
completion of loading a 3D scan file, the 2D slicer dialog program of the 
picked detector will pop up. Then a user can use various buttons to pick 
the axis, slicer # to access desired image slice, to run PLOT2D, ASCII, 
PICK1D viewing program on the selected detector's 3D array.

A 2D Menu allows the user to run various 2D programs to access the lower 
level 2D data array.
