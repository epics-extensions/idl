 NAME:
	BOX_CURSOR

 PURPOSE:
	Emulate the operation of a variable-sized box cursor (also known as
	a "marquee" selector).

 CATEGORY:
	Interactive graphics.

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	BOX_CURSOR, x0, y0, nx, ny [, INIT = init] [, FIXED_SIZE = fixed_size]

 INPUTS:
	No required input parameters.

 OPTIONAL INPUT PARAMETERS:
	x0, y0, nx, and ny give the initial location (x0, y0) and 
	size (nx, ny) of the box if the keyword INIT is set.  Otherwise, the 
	box is initially drawn in the center of the screen.

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
	INIT:  If this keyword is set, x0, y0, nx, and ny contain the initial
	parameters for the box.

	FIXED_SIZE:  If this keyword is set, nx and ny contain the initial
	size of the box.  This size may not be changed by the user.

	MESSAGE:  If this keyword is set, print a short message describing
	operation of the cursor.

 OUTPUTS:
	x0:  X value of lower left corner of box.
	y0:  Y value of lower left corner of box.
	nx:  width of box in pixels.
	ny:  height of box in pixels. 

	The box is also constrained to lie entirely within the window.

 COMMON BLOCKS:
	None.

 SIDE EFFECTS:
	A box is drawn in the currently active window.  It is erased
	on exit.

 RESTRICTIONS:
	Works only with window system drivers.

 PROCEDURE:
	The graphics function is set to 6 for eXclusive OR.  This
	allows the box to be drawn and erased without disturbing the
	contents of the window.

	Operation is as follows:
	Left mouse button:   Move the box by dragging.
	Middle mouse button: Resize the box by dragging.  The corner
		nearest the initial mouse position is moved.
	Right mouse button:  Exit this procedure, returning the 
			     current box parameters.

 MODIFICATION HISTORY:
	DMS, April, 1990.
	DMS, April, 1992.  Made dragging more intutitive.
	June, 1993 - Bill Thompson
			prevented the box from having a negative size.
       04-18-96   bkc  Made the box color more visible.

 NAME:
	CATCHER_V1

 PURPOSE:
       EPICS 3.12.2 Scan record data acquistion tool.

       This program provides the EPICS user a convenient IDL data 
       acquistion tool.  It calls the IDL external CA functions which 
       are defined in the ezcaIDL package. 

       Currently, this program can capture both 1D and 2D scan data
       through setting monitor on the EPICS scan record. During data
       acquisition it also provides real-time plotting. Post acquisition
       it also provides primitive 1D and 2D post data plot and analysis. 
       Each scan record can support up-to four positioners and fifteen
       detectors."

 CATEGORY:
	Widgets. 

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	CATCHER_V1 

 INPUTS:
	None

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
     CONFIG:   Specifies the configuration file to be saved when data
               catcher is normally terminated. If not specified, the 
               default configuration file name 'catch1d.config' is 
               assumed.
     DATA:     Specifies the data file name to be used for appending 
               new captured scan data. If not specified, the default 
               data file name 'catch1d.trashcan' is assumed.
     ENVFILE:  Specifies the environment (process variables) file to
               be saved with the captured scan data. If not specified,
               the default environment file name 'catch1d.env' is 
               assumed.
     NOSAVE:   Turns off the autosave feature. If it is specified, the
               data catcher will be able to display the life data but
               data will not be recorded.
     VIEWONLY: Runs the data catcher as a scan data browser. If it is 
               specified, it can only display the recorded scan data 
               from a saved data file. 
     GROUP:    The widget ID of the group leader of the widget.  If this 
               keyword is specified, the death of the group leader results in
               the death of CATCHER_V1.

 OUTPUTS:
       It provides realtime plot and various post acquistion 1D and
       2D surface plot. In addition of DATA file is saved, if 2D scan 
       is detected the DATA.image file will also be saved at the end 
       of 2D scan. Various levels of report files can also be generated 
       by this program.  All the file generated will be prefixed by the 
       DATA file name.

 COMMON BLOCKS:
       CATCH1D_COM
       W_PLOTSPEC_BLOCK
       W_VIEWSCAN_BLOCK
       REALTIME_BLOCK 
       ENV_FIELD_BLOCK
       FIELD_BLOCK

 SIDE EFFECTS:
       It is capable to detect scan invoked by outside channel access
       client.

 RESTRICTIONS:
       Supports EPICS 3.12.2 and later scan record.

 PROCEDURE:
       For live data acquisition: boot the IOC first, setup and initialize
       the scan records, setup the run ezcaIDL environment, run IDL,
       then start up the data catcher at the IDL prompt. 
       
       A simplified UNIX script file catcher can be used for starting up 
       this program. For help on catcher enter "catcher -h" at the UNIX
       prompt.

 EXAMPLE:
       Use default setting for config, envfile, and data file

       CATCHER_V1

       Override the default setting for config, envfile, and data file, 
       the 'test' is used for this example.

       CATCHER_V1, CONFIG='test.config', ENVFILE='test.env', DATA='test.dat'

 PURPOSE:

       This program is specially written for the data catcher. It
       provides the IDL user a convenient post data acquisition
       1D data display program. It shares the common 1D data file
       with data catcher without interrupting the process of data
       scanning of data catcher.

 CATEGORY:
	Widgets. 

 CALLING SEQUENCE:
	VIEW1D [,Data='test.dat'] [,Config='test.config'] [,/XDR] [GROUP=Group] 

 INPUTS:
	None

 KEYWORD PARAMETERS:
     CONFIG:   Specifies whether the configuration file to be used in the 
               startup of the VIEW1D.
     DATA:     Specifies the 1D file name to be used for displaying 
               captured 1D scan data. If not specified, the default 
               data file name 'catch1d.trashcan' is assumed.
     XDR:      Indicates whether the data file entered on the command line is
               in XDR format.
     GROUP:    The widget ID of the group leader of the widget.  If this 
               keyword is specified, the death of the group leader results in
               the death of VIEW1D.

 OUTPUTS:
       It provides various post acquistion 1D scan displaying features. 
       Various levels of report files can be generated by this program.  
       All the file generated will be prefixed by the DATA file name.

 COMMON BLOCKS:
       VIEW1D_COM
       W_PLOTSPEC_BLOCK
       W_VIEWSCAN_BLOCK

 SIDE EFFECTS:
       New scan data may be appended at the end of data file if the
       data catcher is runing at the same time and new data 
       is detected by the data catcher. Reload the data file will
       let you access the newly captured scan data from the file.

 RESTRICTIONS:

 PROCEDURE:
       The 'os.init' must be loaded into IDL before invoking the 
       VIEW1D application.

 EXAMPLE:
       Use default setting for view1d 

       	VIEW1D

       Override the default setting by specifying config and data file
       on the command line
